<h2>Things I remember with some nostalgia.</h2>
I used to grow up in Nantes. Plenty of good souvenirs.
<h2>The Studies Era</h2>
I moved to Paris at 18 to start studying in <a href="http://www.esme.fr/">ESME Sudria</a> a generic Engineering school.

I graduated in 1995, with a diploma in "Electro-technics and High Power Electronic" (you know big electric motors for
trains and such) with an option in Software Engineering. My diploma project was a 3D graphics renderer using radiosity
based on <a href="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=54852.378487">this Siggraph article</a>
<h2>The 3D software Era</h2>
After school, 3 friends and I founded a company called <strong>RAYflect</strong> where we were developing Ray Dream
Studio, Photoshop and/or 3DS Max 3D plugins, our famous ones were named <strong>Four Elements</strong>, <a href="http://www.freephotoshop.com/html/rayflect.html"><strong></strong></a><strong><a
    href="http://www.freephotoshop.com/html/rayflect.html">Four Seasons</a> or Phototracer</strong>.

The company was eventually aquired by MetaCreations in 1999, and I went to work in their French subsidiary.
<h2>Founding another one</h2>
Back in 2000, the french MetaCreations subsidiary was closed, and the 9 engineers working there decided to start a new
company called <strong>TinCell</strong> founded by an US VC fund called <strong>Ridge Venture</strong>, lead by Eric
Hautemont.

We were mainly doing WAP services and Speech Recognition enabled phone services. The company unfortunately failed
because we were really to early. At that same time I started doing Unix and Linux System Administration and Java
development.
<h2>The boardgames Era at Days of Wonder</h2>
Then in 2002, my former boss joined a new project started by Eric Hautemont: <a href="http://www.daysofwonder.com">a
  boardgame publishing house called Days of Wonder</a>.

I'm primarily developping Java based online games (including the now <a title="Ticket to Ride" href="http://www.daysofwonder.com/tickettoride">famous
  Ticket to Ride train board game</a>.)Â  and spending some time managing the infrastructure and servers for the whole
company using <a href="http://reductivelabs.com/trac/puppet">Reductivelabs Puppet</a>
