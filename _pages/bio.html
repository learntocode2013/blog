<h2>Things I remember with some nostalgia.</h2>
I used to grow up in Nantes. Plenty of good souvenirs.

<h2>The Studies Era</h2>

<p>I moved to Paris at 18 to start studying in <a href="http://www.esme.fr/">ESME Sudria</a> a generic Engineering school.</p>

<p>I graduated in 1995, with a degree in "Electro-technics and High Power Electronic" (you know big electric motors for
trains and such) with an Software Engineering option. My degree project was a 3D graphics renderer using radiosity
based on <a href="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=54852.378487">this Siggraph article</a></p>

<h2>The 3D software Era</h2>

<p>After school, 3 friends and I founded a company called <strong>RAYflect</strong> where we were developing Ray Dream
Studio, Photoshop and 3DS Max 3D plugins, our famous ones were named <strong>Four Elements</strong>, <a href="http://www.freephotoshop.com/html/rayflect.html"><strong></strong></a><strong><a
    href="http://www.freephotoshop.com/html/rayflect.html">Four Seasons</a> or Phototracer</strong>.</p>

<p>The company was eventually aquired by MetaCreations in 1999, and I went to work in their French subsidiary.</p>

<h2>Founding another one</h2>

<p>Back in 2000, the french MetaCreations subsidiary was closed, and the 9 engineers working there decided to start a new
company called <strong>Tincell</strong> founded by an US VC fund called <strong>Ridge Venture</strong>.</p>

<p>We were mainly doing WAP services and Speech Recognition enabled phone services. The company unfortunately failed
because we were really to early. At that same time I started doing Unix and Linux System Administration and Java
development.</p>

<h2>The boardgames Era at Days of Wonder</h2>

<p>Then in 2002, my former boss and I joined a new project: <a href="http://www.daysofwonder.com">a
  boardgame publishing house called Days of Wonder</a>. The idea was to publish the best board games possible, but also their online counterpart.</p>

<p>I developped some Java based online games (including the now <a title="Ticket to Ride" href="http://www.daysofwonder.com/tickettoride">famous
  Ticket to Ride train board game</a>.)Â  and built the infrastructure for the whole
company using mostly <a href="http://puppet.com/">Puppet</a>.</p>

<p>I also created and developed a generic online game cluster for turn by turn board games written in Scala using Akka which is still in use for all our games.</p>

<h2>The Asmodee times</h2>

<p>Eventually, <a href="https://fr.asmodee.com/fr/index/">Asmodee</a> acquired Days of Wonder to form <a href="http://www.asmodee-digital.com/en/">Asmodee Digital</a> in 2014.</p>

<p>There we opened what we developed at Days of Wonder to a larger audience with the aim to port the numerous Asmodee physical distinct boardgames to the digital and mobile world with great success. We're now operating a platform to develop games.</p>

<p>I'm now leading the infra team (especially our move to Kubernetes) and the online game service team, and acting as a technology architect.</p>
