This morning I got the joy to see that my Puppet Camp 2009 slides had been selected by Slideshare to appear on their [home page](http://www.slideshare.net):

Waouh. For a surprise, that's a surprise. I guess those stock photos I used are the underlying reason for this.

Still now that I talk about Puppet Camp again, I forgot to give the links to some pictures taken during the event:

and
