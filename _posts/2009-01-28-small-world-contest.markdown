You certainly know that I work for the [boardgame publisher Days of Wonder](http://www.daysofwonder.com), 
and we announced a couple of days ago our [new boardgame Small World](http://www.daysofwonder.com/smallworld):

[![](http://blog.daysofwonder.com/wp-content/dow-uploads/2009/01/boxshot_sw.jpg)](http://www.daysofwonder.com/smallworld)

What's cool, is that we also [launched a special contest](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/contest/smallworld/ "Small World - Only the Fittest Will Survive - Contest") 
in partnership with [BoardGame Geek](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/). 

In **Small World**, you control several [typical med-fan races](http://blog.daysofwonder.com/2009/01/25/trolls-troll-power/) 
(Elves, Amazons, Trolls...) combined with special abilities, who use their troops to
occupy territory and conquer adjacent lands in order to push the other races
off the face of the earth in the hope that they will rise to the top of this
brutal land grab!In this contest, you have a single chance to vote for the
character you think deserves to be the top race (or at least the one you
believe other voters will pick as the most popular). 
In addition to voting for your favorite, you will also make two more selections to choose the races you
predict will end up 2nd and 3rd most popular.

Participants who vote for the race that rises to the top and has the MOST top
race votes when the contest ends will be the proud recipient of a Small World
Bumper Sticker/Decal featuring the winning race.

Even better, if in addition to picking the winning
race, you also are _one of the first 10 participants_ to correctly _predict which races_ 
end up as the #2 and #3 races (i.e. the 2nd and 3rd race to
collect the most votes from contestants as their top pick), you will also win
a free copy of Small World!Here's the kicker (and what makes the voting
dynamics really interesting)...


The _current vote totals are visible in real-time_ to other entrants, 
so you can see how each race stands before you vote.
The longer you wait to vote, the more likely you are to correctly guess
which Race might rise to the top (and to the all important #2 and # 3 slots).

But if you wait too long, the more likely you are to lose out on the chance to
win a copy of Small World since other participants will likely have made the
same "correct" votes earlier.  
Thus it may **be a good strategy to vote early and then lobby**, cajole (and bribe?!) 
all of your friends to come vote for the same races you voted for, in the hope that they can help your picks rise
to the top!

Here are the current top races results:
