Paris is more and more becoming the _DevOps_ place to be. We (apparently) successfully rebooted the [Paris DevOps Meetups](http://parisdevops.fr/), with already [two](http://parisdevops.fr/blog/2013/02/12/prochain-meetup-le-mardi-19-fevrier.html) [events](http://parisdevops.fr/blog/2013/02/22/prochain-meetup-le-mardi-5-mars.html) so far, and two more already in the pipeline (stay tuned for the announcements). 

We're now announcing and pushing hard the [Paris edition of devopsdays](http://www.devopsdays.org/events/2013-paris/) (well we're quite under the shadow of [devopsdays London](http://www.devopsdays.org/events/2013-london/) at this time; I take this as an extension to our [long time friendly fight with Britons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France%E2%80%93United_Kingdom_relations) :)

The _Paris edition of DevOpsDays_ is being held **18 - 19 April 2013**, and we want you to be a part of it!  This conference brings together speakers and attendees from around the world, with a focus on _DevOps_ culture, techniques, and best practices.

The format is simple: talks in the morning, and open/hack spaces in the afternoon. We've done 17 very successful events on 5 continents, and we're looking forward to [another great edition here](http://www.devopsdays.org/events/2013-paris/)!

Perhaps you’re curious, "what exactly is DevOps?"

Well if you already follow this blog, or [my twitter account](https://twitter.com/_masterzen_) you might already know what is under this term. The term is, of course, a portmanteau of Development and Operations, and is perhaps best thought of as a cultural movement within the IT world.  It stresses communication, collaboration and integration between software developers and IT professionals. [DevOps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps) is a response to, and evolution of, the interdependence of software development and IT operations.

The conference itself will be held at the [MAS](http://www.devopsdays.org/events/2013-paris/location/). Tickets can be purchased for one or both days, and include full access to the talks and spaces, as well as a catered lunch.  

What’s more, we’re currently offering 25% off of the ticket price - just use the code _WELOVEDEVOPS_ when [you register](http://www.devopsdays.org/events/2013-paris/registration/). This is a limited-time offer (until the end of this week), so don’t delay!

And, of course, the [Call for Proposals](http://devopsdays.org/events/2013-paris/propose/) is still open until **20 March 2013**.

Finally, we invite you to peruse the [list of proposals](http://devopsdays.org/events/2013-paris/proposals/), and to comment and vote for your favorite ones!

So if you had to choose one _devopsdays_ this year, choose ours and come

* exchange with lots of talented French people
* taste French food and wine
* learn how we do _devops_ in 3 hours of work per day (just kidding of course)
* smell the fragrance of Paris in spring (there won't be any more snow, I promise)
* visit the [City of Lights](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris)

Looking forward to seeing you in April!
